# New Cafe
## (It's Magically Expensive)

This is my final assignment for my C++ 2 class and I was tasked with making a cafe.
I've done this before and I decided to learn another way to make this easier to navigate, my biggest issue so far is getting the map to actually show when you compile it.

This is what we have to do for the project which I will paste below.
- your job is to model a cafe. you must have a menu of 5 items with prices. users can choose items and pay. they can only pay in whole dollars and you must give change in
the lowest amount of currency possible (example: if i pay for something that is 2.35 cents with 5 dollars i must get back 1 nickle, 1 dime, 2 quarters and 2 dollars)

Not a lot to do but I want to try something differnt to show how much I have improved over the year since my first C++ class. These are things I want to implement in this as well.
- I would like to incorporate ascii art once again
- fixing old mistakes
- use a menu of 5 items
- give correct change in the lowest amount of currency possible 
- create good usability

The compiler I used was the linux add on with visual studio using cmake.
